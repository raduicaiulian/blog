			Problem solving:
				[Disclaimer]
				This blog is written without to much research on the subject, so if you researched it eought that I mke you fell that something of what i write is wrong, please write me at raduicaiulian@gmail.com using "radusan blog" as subject(this subject is used by my mail filters to make sure that the email ia not ending up in the spam folder, instead it is placed into a special folder to which helps me keep the imbox clean).
				If you are interested in this topic from the perspective of Computer Science and want the best aproch on this topic then this(vlad rtfm) page may be more apropiat for you but If you find the size of that page overwhelming, would like a more generalist aproch or you are a fan of more of a vizual representation(like images and videos) this maybe a more suitable alternative. 

				[Motivation]
				There are two reasons why I wanted to write this blog:

				-There is a person that keeps coming to me in order to get help with her problem, I'm not talkig about programing questions or Computer Science related problems, general things like "I need to get this thing done by x date. Please help me!" or "I have to solve this prolem. Please fix it! " :)

				-I see to often people asking obvious questions, past myself incuded, and the outcome is one of the following: either they get offende when receive some answer like "This place is not appropriate for your question", RTFM or this(rtfm from vlad), either they do not have enough patience to answare to the queationa that someone asks in order to help them and here I found the following situations(either they do not really think that someone really can help them so just asking and expecting someone will just come with the right answare(this may happen because they were asked in the past almost the same questions and the guy who asked them dezinformed them or just was not able to provide an answare  ) ) responsable for why this this reason make people get offended.

				In this article [check the definition of an article] I'll try to describe the steps that I follow in order to solve a problem, any problem, and will do this by
