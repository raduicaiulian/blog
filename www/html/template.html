<h3>Raw copy</h3>

		One of the first use cases was to backup a 128 SSD in order to test something on some distro, talking about a relative small disk I tried to copy it using <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html">dd(1)</a>, the result was pretty inconvenient because the whole process took <div id="popup">about 4h<span>this was because the destination drive was a sshfs share with a NIC of only 100 Mb/s ~ 12.5 MB/s</span></div> and, nevertheless, faced some file system corruption because I forgot to unmount the drive that were backed up at that time, apart from that dd did his job but used 128 GB of storage even if the allocated space on that disk was under 50%.

			These days I had the 
			<div id="popup">following setup
				<span>
					<ul>
						<li>an internal nvme M.2(256 GB)</li>
						<li>an external SSD(128 GB)</li>
					</ul>
				</span>
			
			</div>, and decided that I would like to change the os from the <div id="popup">first disk<span>256 GB one</span></div>.

<h3>Backup of each partition</h3>
		This is a slightly more advanced approach because comes with the following advantages:
			<ul>
				<li>takes way less space</li>
				<li>it runs faster</li>
				<li>it is easier to resize a partition</li>
			</ul>
		The steps used to make this kind of backup where the following:

		<h3>Solutions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>raw copy of the entire drive using dd</li>
			<li>backup the partitioning scheme(MBR/GPT) and each partition independently</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>How it went</h3>
	<p>
	In the past I used the first solution in order to backup <div id="popup">the external disk<span>128 GB one</span></div> to <div id="popup">another PC<span>via sshf wich runs on top of a 500 GB HDD</span></div>, it worked but with the following <div id="popup">limitations<span><ul><li>it was verry slow(thanks to the 100 Mb/s Ethernet NIC )</li><li>cupied a lod of space( 128GB )</li></ul></u></span></div> also thanks to my <div id="popup">negligence<span>I forgot that the system was runing was on the same disk wich provoked some filesystems coruptions</span></div>, so if you ever intend to make this kind of backup preas remember to unmount the disk that you are copying.
	</p>

		Fot that usecase a raw coppy was pretty ok becouse the disk was about 80% full, but now I'm facing the case that I have a disk wich is about 11% full, in this a raw backup is not eficient so I will explore the second solution.
