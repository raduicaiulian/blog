    By system backups I'm refering to makeing a copy of the entire drive that contains am os on it, so in this blog we'll take a look at the most convenient options available to make this kind of backups.
    <h3>Problem</h3>
      These days I had the 
      <div id="popup">following setup
        <span>
          <ul>
            <li>an internal nvme M.2(256 GB)</li>
            <li>an external SSD(128 GB)</li>
          </ul>
        </span>
      
      </div>, and decided that I would like to change the os from the first <div id="popup">disk<span>256 GB one</span></div>.



    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>raw copy of the entire drive using dd</li>
      <li>backup the partitioning scheme(MBR/GPT) and each partition independently</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>How it went</h3>
  <p>
  In the past I used the first solution in order to backup <div id="popup">the external disk<span>128 GB one</span></div> to <div id="popup">another PC<span>via sshf wich runs on top of a 500 GB HDD</span></div>, it worked but with the following <div id="popup">limitations<span><ul><li>it was verry slow(thanks to the 100 Mb/s Ethernet NIC )</li><li>cupied a lod of space( 128GB )</li></ul></u></span></div> also thanks to my <div id="popup">negligence<span>I forgot that the system was runing was on the same disk wich provoked some filesystems coruptions</span></div>, so if you ever intend to make this kind of backup preas remember to unmount the disk that you are copying.
  </p>

    Fot that usecase a raw coppy was pretty ok becouse the disk was about 80% full
