		<h1>How to repair the bootloader the ultimate guide<h1>

		<p>
			If you feel that the process of booting is getting in your way every time you are tring to make a dual boot setup or boot repair is not solving you specific problem or maybe yout bios menu is somewhat different than from you old pc and does not allow you to manage the entryes form boot menu, then this blog is for you. In this blog I propose to explayn the boot process, with as much details as possible, on x86/x86_64(amd64) in order to overcome any problem that may appear during boot process.

		***EFI Boot Stub makes it possible to boot a Linux kernel image without the use of a conventional UEFI boot loader(maskuarade)***

			As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#VARIABLE">wikipedia</a> mentions "EFI defines two types of services: boot services and runtime services."
