			In this article I will decribe how the boot process works based on my experience (gained from online ressources and practical exemples done by myself), for the most part I will focus on the issues that can araise durng boot process.

			I will not hezitate to referenence the best online resources that hellped me to overcome most of the issues, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, becouse obviously I'm not the most knowledgeable person that tackles this problem.
			<br><br>

			<h2>How the boot process works</h2>
			Becouse "A picture is worth more than a thousand words" I think it is helpfull to ilustrate a high level overview of main components that interacts during boot process.

			<br><br><br>
			<embed id="d1" src="/images/2/boot_process.svg">
			<p class="diagram">diagram: d1</p>
			<br>			

			The takeaway from diagram <a href="#d1">d1</a> is that the firmware is the pice of software trigered whem the power button is pressed.
			It performs a set of tasks required to turn on the system and passes control to the <div class="popup">primary bootloader</div> which can pass the control further either to a <div class="popup">secondarybootloader</div> either to the <div class="popup">operating system</div>.<br>
			The secondary bootloader is used becouse it gives more flexibility( f.e. understands more file sytems than the firmware, you can customize it easyer) because it resids on disk and overwriting it is not as dangerous as overwriting the firmware wich may leave your system in an unusable state.
			<br>
			If you do not care about this flexibility you can make the primary bootloader of the firmware to pass the execution controll straight to to OS, from my knologe Linux <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EFI_stub">support</a> this kind of feature if it is booted using UEFI.
			<br><br>
			The OS is dependent of the firmware that is trying boot him so alway make sure that the specific version of the os you intend to install is compatible with your firmware.
	
			Both UEFI and BIOS are distinct pieces of firmware which are responsable to "perform hardware initialization during the booting process" and "provide runtime services for operating systems and programs"<a class="sup" id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1">1</a>;<br>

			Both UEFI and BIOS uses partition table to find out where is the (secondary) bootloader located<a class="sup" id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2">2</a>;<br>

				<li id="fn:1">so <div class="popup">do not</div> associate these two terms together because they are not the same thing nor UEFI is an extension of BIOS, if you do such someone may get annoyed <a href="#fnref:1">↩</a>
				</li>
				<li id="fn:2">
					Tehnicaly speaking the (secondary) bootloader is located either on <div class="popup">boot partition</div> so this means that <div class="popup">partition table</div> is used to identify one of these two partitions in order to be able to acces the (secondary) bootloader<a href="#fnref:2">↩</a>
