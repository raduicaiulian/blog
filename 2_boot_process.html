			In this article, I'll describe how the boot process works focusing on three core components(firmware, bootloader, partition table) of boot process wich need to be understood in order to configure a multiboot system and troubleshoot boot problems. <br><br>
		
			<h2>How the boot process works</h2>
			Becouse "A picture is worth more than a thousand words" I think it is helpfull to ilustrate a high level overview of main components that interacts during boot process.

			<br><br><br>
			<embed id="d1" src="/blog/images/2/boot_process.svg">
			<p class="diagram">diagram: d1</p>
			<br>			

			The takeaway from diagram <a href="#d1">d1</a> is that the <div class="popup">firmware</div> is the pice of software trigered whem the power button is pressed.
			It performs a set of tasks required to turn on the system and passes control to the <div class="popup">primary bootloader</div> which can pass the control further either to a <div class="popup">secondary bootloader</div> either to the <div class="popup">operating system</div>if the os supports to be booted directly.<br>
			The  <div class="popup">partition table</div> is used to store data about how partitions are oraganized on disk, depending on your firmware you may want to use different pacrtition tables(f.e. UEFI require GPT while BIOS can theoreticaly work with both MBR and GPT but this vary form one bios implementation to other, see <a href="https://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/bios.html">this</a>), also keep in mind that GPT has some advantages over MBR.<br>

			Both UEFI and BIOS use a partition table to find the location of thethe secondary bootloader;<br>

			The <div class="popup">secondary bootloader</div> is used becouse it gives more flexibility( f.e. understands more file sytems than the firmware, you can customize it easyer) because it resids on disk and overwriting it is not as dangerous/hard as overwriting the firmware wich may leave your system in an unusable state as long as you do not have a copy of the firmware available and you are unwilling/unable to solder wires directly on your motherboard.
			<br>
			If you do not care about this flexibility you can make the primary bootloader of the firmware to pass the execution controll straight to to OS, Linux <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EFI_stub">support</a> this kind of feature if it is booted using UEFI.
			<br><br>
			The OS is dependent of the firmware that is trying boot him so alway make sure that the specific version of the os you intend to install is compatible with your firmware.
	
			Both UEFI and BIOS are distinct<a class="sup" id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1">1</a> pieces of firmware which are responsable to "perform hardware initialization during the booting process" and "provide runtime services for operating systems and programs";<br>
